# 🎮 Simple Tic Tac Toe - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This is a basic implementation of the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The project includes two different versions of the game to demonstrate different approaches to implementing interactivity.

## ✨ Features

- Playable Tic Tac Toe game (X vs O)
- Turn-based logic with visual indicators
- Win and draw detection
- Reset functionality
- Responsive, minimal design with some animations

## 📂 Files Included

### `tictactoe.html`
- Uses **event listeners directly on each cell** to control the game flow.
- Basic logic written inline to handle moves, wins, and resets.
- Demonstrates a more direct, event-driven approach.

### `tictactoewithfunction.html`
- Uses **modular functions** like `makeMove()`, `checkWinner()`, and `resetGame()` to manage game state.
- Overlay and animated symbols on win/draw.
- More structured and reusable code for better scalability.

- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Conditional logic
